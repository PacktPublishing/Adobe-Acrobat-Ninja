**A productivity guide with tips and proven techniques for business professionals using Adobe Acrobat**

## What is this book about?
For some users, PDF is the final output for reports, journals, or white papers. Others may need to collect and organize information using PDF forms. Graphic designers, editors, and writers need to present drafts for reviews and receive feedback. Laws in many countries stipulate that access to information must not be restricted to readers with physical impairments, requiring that PDF publications be accessible to assistive devices. Some documents must be available for many years or decades, thus setting up archive features requires consideration. All these scenarios involve some features of Acrobat.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use Adobe Acrobat Pro efficiently through shortcuts and preferences
* Expand your knowledge of the functions that you already use
* Understand the connection between PDFs, Acrobat, and other applications
* Find out about unique settings in Adobe InDesign to create high-quality fully featured PDFs
* Address legal concerns for information published in a digital format
* Confidently move away from the use of ink and paper and help preserve physical resources
